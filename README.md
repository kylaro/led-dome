# led-dome
Real-time LED Dome simulator AND controller. The control is done through E131 / sACN packets to a Falcon F48. However, it is not configurable and is application specific to our particular dome and Falcon F48 setup.

Please enjoy the timelapse of this project being built!

Requires Easy3D to compile. This is for visualizing the simulation.
There is a .exe to run this in the repo. Use arrow keys to change the pattern. Xbox controller to control the snake - it's much cooler in real life though.

built with Visual Studio 2019, requires Easy3D to be installed, https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D just need to build that and then point Easy3D_DIR to it in config.
